- Comments: Everything looks near perfect in the desktop format but there was a catering maine picture that was around 3 pixels too small and the photos borders radius is too round and a bit thin
- tablet modes photos page could be more responsive, the about pages pictures being a slide scroll is cool and works great, mean while the main page is not responsive for either tablet or phone, other wise no further complaints, looks great
- mobile looks great not much to add other then the photos looks better than the tablet and main is still not responsive
- over all they did a great job rebuilding the prototype and had some creative ideas for responsiveness. i loved the nav bar drop down and the footers responsivnes
